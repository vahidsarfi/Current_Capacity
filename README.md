# Current_Capacity
<p>This app is written using VB6 to calculate the current capacity of cables 
for either buried or in air cables. In addition, it does consider the the number of feeders and cores for each trench or tray</p>
 
<p>This app is useful for HV and MV cable installation.</p>
<p>I built it on December 2012 when I was working for "Moghan Wire and Cable" company. http://moghancableco.com/new/index.php/en/</p>
